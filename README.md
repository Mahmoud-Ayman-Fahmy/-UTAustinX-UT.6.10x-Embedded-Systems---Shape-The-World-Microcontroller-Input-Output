# -UTAustinX-UT.6.10x-Embedded-Systems---Shape-The-World-Microcontroller-Input-Output
The code I implemented in edx embedded system course from edx online that works on simulation and hardware with full grade and certified in two parts of course
# Description :- 
This codes implemented by me to solve labs of this course and get full grade with simulate and hardware but connect the component of hardware well first to work well and they found commented in codes that downloaded from course itself to explain what should you do and finish and then you write your solution.
# Certificate :-
Part1 --> https://courses.edx.org/certificates/ffe3959c4e2642d090441e5e462ac7ba
# Requirements :- 
IDE : Kiel uVsion 4 your simulate and hardware grader and test on this IDE
